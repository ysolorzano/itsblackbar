        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h2>what is black bar?</h2>
        <h3>Black bar is a website made for a woman who had a long day and
          doesn't feel like going home yet. Instead, she wants to go get a drink
          at a cute bar with some even cuter girls to unwind and talk about
          everything and nothing at the same time. </h3>
        <h2>what makes you eligible?</h2>
        <h3>Having ovaries. This isn’t about race, heritage, background, sexuality,
          or motives in life. This is about women.</h3>
        <h2>why the name black bar?</h2>

          Slimming is good. We love slimming.</h3>
        <h2>what are the rules?</h2>
        <h3>Don't be dramatic, don't be judgey, and don't be offended -
          three things that shouldn't have to made clear and the fact that
          you even thought there were rules to a girl get together to begin
          with is already concerning.</h3>

        <h3>Two women who want more estrogen in their life.</h3>
        <h2>how does black bar work?</h2>
        <h3>You check the website and you show up. Say you're with
          black bar and you will be pointed to the dark side.</h3>
        <h2>how do you chose which bar to go to?</h2>
        <h3>We're starting by checking off our personal list of places
          we've been wanting to try but we're always, always, always up to try
          something new! Email us with suggestions!</h3>
